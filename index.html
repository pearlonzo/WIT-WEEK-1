                  <p>codind is fun and it is good for peoples health 
                        about learning to code and working as a programmer often focus on the perks and benefits associated with the field—things like flexible job schedules, high pay (even for entry-level positions), and opportunities to work remotely. But what about the job itself? From the outside looking in,
                         coding can seem like endless hours of typing gibberish onto a computer screen—a task that, quite frankly, sounds pretty boring. Do coders put up with fundamentally boring work just to get those perks and benefits? Or is the work of coding significantly
                         different than what a newcomer might think?
                         To get a solid answer, 
                        I spoke with two coders. 
                        Read on to hear what they had to say.
                        coding is not boring

                            is—quite simply—”not.” Of course personal preferences can vary,
                             but coding is so not boring

                        some of the less fun parts of coding actually 
                        lead right back to what
                         makes coding special in the first place.
                         “The technologies are always 
                        changing and going in and out of style,” Kager says,
                         “so you have to be really adaptable and willing 
                        to keep learning both in and out of work.” 
                        While Kager says that this can sometimes be tiring,
                         but at the end of the day the process of constant 
                        learning is exactly what makes coding so engaging.
